Streams and Buffers

Buffers

- temporary storage spot for a chunk of data that is being transferred from one place to another

- the buffer is filled with data, then passed along

- transfer small chunks of data at a time

Stream 

- stream of data that flows over time from one place to another 

THINK about streaming movies!!!!

how one is consuming data or watching the movie before its even finished completely gathering all the data. all the while info/data is still actively buffering 

Streams in Node.js

- can create streams in Node.js to transfer data
- increase performance
