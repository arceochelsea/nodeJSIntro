Clients and Servers

Protocols 
- A set of communation rules, that two sides agree to use when communicating 

- Client and server will both use this as a means of communication with one another ("rules" protocols)

- If a client wants to connect to a server then it must first connect to the IP address and it will open a socket between the two computers, basically a channel which info can be sent. info sent is structured via different protocols. ex FTP or Http.

FTP 

- File Transfer Protocol

HTTP 

- used for websites 

- when structure for the info to be sent is decided, info is sent down the socket between two computers via protocol called TCP.

TCP 

- splits up the data in smaller pieces to transfer down the socket. Small pieces/ sections are called packets. 

Ports 

- A program running on a computer can listen for requests sent to a particular port number 

NodeJS will be listening to certain ports in order to know that certain info wants to be passed through.
